Welcome on the main page of the MarioPizzaOriginal project! There were few goals to create this program: first of all the must to create something for Usages of OOP at University. Second: I assume this is as my portfolio project. Third: I wanted to mess around in various design patterns and technologies (and git of course!)
### Key features
 1. You can manage your restaurant products database: add, edit, remove products
 2. Rights system - driver / cashier / system administrator see different menu options
 3. All orders in one place - you can analyse what are the hottest products (reports in plans)
### Technologies
 - C#
 - .Net Framework 4.7
 - SQLite
 - ServiceStack.Ormlite (ADO/ORM)
 - TinyIoC (DI)
 - NUnit
 - Pastel (console colors)
 - Design patterns: MVC, DI, IoC, Repository
 - travis-ci build server
